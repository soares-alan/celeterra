# Project: Corporate Website for Client
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Live-brightgreen) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

I developed a modern and responsive website for a client in the **civil construction** sector, with the primary goal of digitizing and optimizing the presentation of their services. This project was carefully crafted to meet the client's specific expectations and needs, ensuring a platform that not only highlights their unique selling points but also offers an impeccable user experience.

By utilizing classic and functional web technologies, I focused on essential pillars such as **accessibility**, **loading speed**, and **intuitive navigation**. The result is a website that not only adapts perfectly to any device but also ensures the content is easily accessible and understood by all visitors, without compromising performance. Every detail was designed to reflect the **solidity and quality** of the client's services in the civil construction industry.
